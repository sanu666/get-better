Problem Statement:- 

<h1>Design a Stateful Vending Machine</h1>

When in an interview we are faced with such a generic question, it's important to understand the requirements first.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
Let's say I want to design a vending machine.
I want to add the following functionality:-

1. Machine should keep track of inventory.
2. A person should be able to insert cash and choose an item.
3. Machine needs to do validation with item price.
4. The Machine must display an error in case of insufficient cash or unavailable item.
5. Finally, if all the above steps succeed then the user gets the selected item.
